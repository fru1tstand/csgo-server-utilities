# Fru1tMe's CS:GO Server Utilities
A couple of tools I created to help manage my server. Maybe they'll be useful to someone else out there too? Each tool is listed and summarized here, but they each have their own readme detailing their purpose, setup, etc. Feel free to modify and redistribute any part of as long as you give credit where it's due. Also come join our minigames + funmaps server :) `connect csgo.fru1t.me:27015`

## FastDL Sync Manager
